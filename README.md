# GW2-Raid-Log-Parser

Parser for `.evtc` (or zipped `.zevtc`) logs files generated by [arcdps](https://www.deltaconnected.com/arcdps/) for Guild Wars 2.

## Database

After parsing, a document per encounter and per player is inserted into MongoDB.

## Configuration

To make it work, add a `conf.py` file with the following info:
```
mongo = {
	"url": <mongodb url>,
	"port": <mongodb port>
}
path = <path to arcdps logs>
```
